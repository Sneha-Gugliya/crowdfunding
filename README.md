A decentralized crowdfunding smart contract enabling transparent and secure fundraising on blockchain.

Project Description:
Finledger is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform designed to eliminate intermediaries in fundraising. Contributors can directly fund projects, and funds are securely locked until the campaign goal is achieved. Only the project owner can withdraw funds once conditions are met, ensuring trust and accountability.

Project Vision:
To empower innovators, entrepreneurs, and creators worldwide by providing a decentralized, transparent, and fair crowdfunding solution where trust is built through blockchain technology.

Key Features:
Decentralized Contributions → Anyone can contribute ETH directly to the campaign.
Secure & Conditional Withdrawal → Funds can only be withdrawn by the project owner when the funding goal is achieved.
Transparency → All contributions and fund movements are publicly verifiable on-chain.

Future Scope:
Refund Mechanism → Add support for contributors to reclaim funds if the goal is not met.
Multiple Campaigns → Manage multiple crowdfunding projects within a single smart contract.
Milestone-Based Funding → Enable partial withdrawals when specific milestones are reached.
Frontend Integration → Build a web and mobile dApp for easy interaction.
